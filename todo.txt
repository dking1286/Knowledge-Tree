Todo:
  Figure out how to deal with the problem that I can't
    select datapoints from the database because I
    don't know their exact interest rate value. Maybe
    have it store the interest rate as an integer,
    and then divide it by 1000 when I need to use it?
  Loading all of the datapoints into memory takes up
    too much memory. Is it possible to have it load
    directly from the database as needed instead?
  Implement calculate_payoff_times as a generator
    to allow for progress bar
  Implement load_payoff_times as a generator to allow for progress bar
  *Fix Bar class in view.py to change the coordinates of the rectangle when changing the value of the bar,
    instead of redrawing a new rectangle
  Analyze and fix financial_tools to reflect correct financial formulas
  

Done:
  Implement delete_payoff_times_from_database as a
    generator function
  Create button to delete data from database
  Create GraphManager class to plot points on the Axes
  Fix documentation in View class
  Finish definition and testing of Axes class
  Test Axes with slider to watch points move
